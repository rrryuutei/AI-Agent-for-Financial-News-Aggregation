        <h2>What's Under the Hood?</h2>
        <p>GPT-4 does not know anything after Sept. 2021. Our AI agent is able to utilize external tools like APIs to retrieve what it needs. \n
            In this way we inject the most recent news and data into the model. Here is how it works:</p>
        <ol class="aligned-list">
            <li>Planning: The AI agent determine what are the most relevant stock to explore to answer the user's question.</li>
            <li>Retrieving: The AI agent use API to retrieve the most recent data and news about the stocks.</li>
            <li>Analyzing: By analyzing the recent data and news, the AI agent is able to retrospect on its initial planning and retrieve more data to reflect the most recent trend.</li>
            <li>Summarizing: A well-written answer is summarized by the AI agent based on all the relevant news and data, with grounding information provided for the user.</li>
        </ol>
